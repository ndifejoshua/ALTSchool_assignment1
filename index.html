    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
    <p>
      My decision to join AltSchool Africa was driven by my desire to transition
      into software development, particularly
      <strong>Frontend Engineering</strong>. While i considered the self-taught
      experience, I realized that a well-structured learning, mentorship, and
      hands-on approach(project-based curriculum) would accelerate my learning
      and help me become an industry-ready developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, my personal experience during a family trip where I
      struggled to find medical help due to language barrier and lack of digital
      health solutions, strengthened my resolve to use technology for impactful
      change
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>AltSchool</strong> stood out to me because of its practical
      learning model, industry-aligned curriculum, experienced instructors and
      collaborative student community. The opportunity to work on real-world
      projects, receive mentorship, and develop industry-relevant skills made
      this program the perfect fit for my growth and learning goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Financial constraint also played a role in my decision, making the<strong>
        Ayoba Developer Program Scholarship</strong
      >
      a critical support system in my journey towards becoming a skilled
      software developer
    </p>

    <h2>My Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h2>

        Develop real-world web applications and contribute to open-source
        projects with clean and maintainable code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Expand my network and collaborate with other developers on innovative
        tech solutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gain industry experience through internships and hands-on projects.
      </li>
      <li>Secure opportunities in Software Engineering.</li>
